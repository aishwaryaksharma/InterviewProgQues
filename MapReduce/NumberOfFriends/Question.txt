The input is a number of lines with pairs of name of friends, in the form:
    [Friend1] [Friend2]

The required output is to print the number of friends of each person, in the format shown. The code for the MapReduce class, parts related to IO etc. has already been provided. However, the mapper and reducer functions are incomplete. Your task is to fill up the mapper and reducer functions appropriately, such that the program works, and outputs the list of number of friends of each person , in lexicographical order.

A list of single space separated pairs of friend names. We have already written the input handling code to read in this data.

Output Format
Again, the output handling part has already been provided in the template code. The Key contains [Person name] and the value contains the number of friends, sorted in lexicographical order. The entities in this list, will naturally be confined to only those people provided in the input data.
